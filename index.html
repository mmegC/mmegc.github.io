    <p>The Back Cove neighborhood spans from Forest Avenue to Washington Avenue and Canco Road to Baxter Boulevard. The neighborhood surrounds the Back Cove tidal basin, for which it gets its name. Also referred to as “The Back Bay”, “The Boulevard”, and “The Cove”, the Back Cove neighborhood is a popular area for outdoor activities. Frequently visited parks within the neighborhood include Heseltine Park, Edward Payson Park, Canco Woods, and one of the city's most popular walking and running routes, the 3.6 mile Back Cove Trail.</p>

    <h4>West Bayside</h4>
    <img class="reg-image reg-border center" src="IMG_WestBayside.jpeg" alt= "Photo of West Bayside">
    <p>The neighborhood of West Bayside is sandwiched between Franklin St. to Forest Ave. and Cumberland Ave. to Marginal Way.  West Bayside is home to many manufacturing buildings and social servies, but also a vibrant and diverse community.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Walking Trails/Areas:</b>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Small: </b>The Bayside trail connects the West Bayside and East Bayside neighborhoods, and is the perfect distance for a short walk (1 mile).

                <br>
                <li><b>Medium: </b> Deering Oaks is another great place to walk and is easy to access from anywhere in the West Bayside Neighborhood. It features a playground, duck pond, tennis courts, and a baseball field between its paths.

                <br>
                <li><b>Large: </b> Like many neighborhoods in Portland, West Bayside has quick access to the Back Cove Trail. The trail can be accessed from the Bayside Trail. Another option splitting off from the Bayside Trail is the Eastern Promenade Trail which looks out over Casco Bay.

    <h4>Deering Center</h4>
    <img class="reg-image reg-border center" src="deeringcenter.jpg" alt="Photo of Deering Center">
    <p>Known for its quiet neighborhoods, proximity to schools and parks, and assortment of small shops, Deering Center is a great place to explore. The neighborhood sits between Woodford St. to Walton St. and Forest Ave. to Brighton Ave.. A very walkable neighborhood, Deering Center includes many areas of recreation including Presumpscot Park and Mayor Baxter Woods as well as Evergreen Cemetery in the Riverton neighborhood which borders Deering Center. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Walking Trails/Areas:</b>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Small: </b> If your're looking for a short walk, Baxter Pines and the Deering High School campus are a good place to go. Starting on Leland St. and walking up the hill to Pleasant St., down Stevens Ave., and looping back to Leland St. via Ludlow St., is just a little less than a mile. A loop through Baxter Pines or around the baseball fields would add some extra distance.
                <br><a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/so2Z2ycrqYAkfWWU9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map</a></li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Medium: </b> Baxter Woods, a 30 acre nature preserve between Stevens Ave. and Forest Ave. has a small network of trails that can be combined for a bit of a longer walk. Especially in hot summer months, the tall pines provide plenty of shade to stay cool.

                <li><b>Large: </b> While Evergreen Cemetery techinically lies in the Riverton neighborhood, it's entrances are on streets that are part of Deering Center. The garden style cemetery is home to many trails, carriage paths, and even duck ponds, giving walkers hours of land to cover and enjoy.

    <h4>Downtown</h4>
    <img class="reg-image reg-border center" src="downtown2.jpg" alt="Photo of Downtown">
    <p>Downtown Portland is best known for its expansive food, art, and small business scene. Downtown lies between High St. to Franklin St. and Cumberland Ave. to the warerfront. While much of the Downtown neighborhood is taken up large bulidings and busy streets, there are no shortage of places to walk around and explore. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Walking Trails/Areas:</b>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Small:</b> One of the most common places to walk Downtown is just on the the streets. There are many quiet cobblestone streets that lead right towards the waterfront. Lincoln Park on Pearl St. is a good place to start.
                <br><a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/d78gmHVp2adffh947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map</a></li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Medium:</b> Arguably the most scenic route in Portland, the Eastern Promenade trail wraps around the downtown waterfront and the Eastern Promenade. 
                <br><a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/JyCLWXzU3LjJkiYt5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Map</a></li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Large:</b> If you're looking for a long walk, the Harborwalk Trail goes across the Casco Bay bridge into South Portland. This route eventually becomes the South Portland Greenbelt. If you take the Greenbelt to the left and then all the way to the end, you will find yourself at Buglight Park, which has a great view of the Portland harbor.

    <p>The largest neighborhood in Portland, North Deering is located between the Back Cove, East Deering, and Riverton neighborhoods as well as the nearby town of Falmouth. Compared to other neighborhoods in Portland, North Deering is much more suburban, leaving it to have several undeveloped/protected areas. Most notably, North Deering is home to the Presumpscot River Preserve where a section of the Sebago to Sea Trail runs through.</p>

    <p>The name of the small neighborhood sitting between Weymouth St. to Forest Ave. and I-295 to Congress St. is perfectly suited for a neighborhood known for its park, Deering Oaks. However, Deering Oaks isn't the only popular destination to call the Parkside neighborhood home. Parkside has several museums, small businesses, and popular restaurants/cafes.  </p>

Another good route, starting at Deering Oaks, would be to follow State St. onto the Casco Bay Bridge, cross the bridge then turn left on Erskine Dr., then left on Waterman Dr. until the Thomas Knight Park where there is a ramp back onto the bridge. At this point you can go back the same way you came. Depending on where you choose to start in Deering Oaks, this loop is just over 4 miles.
