                <li><b>Small: </b>The Bayside trail connects the West Bayside and East Bayside neighborhoods, and is the perfect distance for a short walk (1 mile).<br>
                <br> Best parking: Parking is available at the end of Marginal way or side streets bordering the trail. <a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/GzYQfa247ZryzKUx9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Map)</a> </li>
                <br>

                <li><b>Small: </b> If your're looking for a short walk, Baxter Pines and the Deering High School campus are a good place to go. Starting on Leland St. and walking up the hill to Pleasant St., down Stevens Ave., and looping back to Leland St. via Ludlow St., is just a little less than a mile. A loop through Baxter Pines or around the baseball fields would add some extra distance.<br>
                <br> Best parking: Along Leland St. or Ludlow St. or in the Deering High School parking lot (not during school hours). <a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/so2Z2ycrqYAkfWWU9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Map)</a></li>

The garden style cemetery is home to many trails, carriage paths, and even duck ponds, giving walkers hours of land to cover and enjoy.<br>
                <br> Best parking: There is parking avaible on the main entrane road to the cemetary and at the end of Brentwood St. across from the community garden. <a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/AspBkM75wJyi27qT9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Map)</a></li>

    <h4>Downtown</h4>
    <p>Downtown Portland is best known for its expansive food, art, and small business scene. Downtown lies between High St. to Franklin St. and Cumberland Ave. to the warerfront.

                <li><b>Small:</b> One of the most common places to walk Downtown is just on the the streets. There are many quiet cobblestone streets that lead right towards the waterfront. Lincoln Park on Pearl St. is a good place to start.<br>
                <br> Best parking: There is on-street parking on most streets in Downtown. Some of the best ones include Federal St., Commercial St., and Spring St.. Metered parking is free on Sundays. <a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/d78gmHVp2adffh947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Map)</a></li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Medium:</b> Arguably the most scenic route in Portland, the Eastern Promenade trail wraps around the downtown waterfront and the Eastern Promenade. <br>
                <br> Best parking: While any of the places for the small walking suggestion would be good for parking, Commercial St. would be the most convenient. <a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/JyCLWXzU3LjJkiYt5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Map)</a></li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Large:</b> If you're looking for a long walk, there is a route that goes across the Casco Bay bridge into South Portland. This route eventually becomes the South Portland Greenbelt. If you take the Greenbelt to the left and then all the way to the end, you will find yourself at Buglight Park, which has a great view of the Portland harbor.<br>
